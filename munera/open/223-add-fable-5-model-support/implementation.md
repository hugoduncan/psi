# Implementation notes

## Reviews

### Architectural-fit review (design) — ψ

Verdict: fits architecture; no new actionable misfit.

- Additive catalog data change; honors catalog single-source-of-truth
  (model_registry/built-in-catalog indexes built-in/all-models).
- `:fable-5` entry structurally identical to existing `:opus-4.8`
  (models.clj) — same provider/api/adaptive-thinking/context-window/pricing
  shape; uses only existing capability fields (no schema extension).
- Structured output wired via established
  `anthropic-json-schema-native-model-keys` set mechanism — consistent
  with existing pattern, not new dispatch.
- Additive-only, no default-selection change → `extend: addition > modification`.
- Extends existing `anthropic_models_api_test.clj` live opt-in proof rather
  than adding a parallel verification mechanism.
- Split capability source (model map + native-key set) is a pre-existing
  project pattern; following it is correct fit, not a task-scoped misfit.
