# Implementation

Created task `166-root-registry-component-build-task` as the implementation follow-on to closed design task `165-root-registry-component-target-architecture`.

Starting point:

- task `165` is now the closed source-of-truth design for the target shared registry architecture
- this task will build the standalone lower component defined there
- migration of existing registries is intentionally deferred to later tasks

Initial next step:

- extract the exact shared state model, operation set, and result contracts from task `165` and turn them into a focused lower-component implementation with tests
