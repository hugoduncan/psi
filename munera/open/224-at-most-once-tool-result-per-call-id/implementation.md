## Architecture-fit review (design.md)

Reviewed design.md for architectural fit (not ambiguity/correctness). Grounded
against AGENTS.md (S1–S3 VSM, dispatch-owns-writes, effects-as-data), META.md,
and doc/architecture.md (State boundary: canonical root vs runtime handles;
Dispatch sequencing contract; tool-execution dispatch ownership).

Fit confirmed (not misfits):
- Single-chokepoint enforcement is sound: both producers (interrupt path
  `turn.clj:223`, real-result path `tool_runtime_adapter.clj:114`) converge on
  the one pure handler `:session/tool-agent-record-result`
  (`session_mutations.clj:529`). Guarding there matches the `one_way` /
  single-source principle.
- First-writer-wins + suppression aligns with the impossible-invalid-states
  ethos (at-most-once invariant on tool-call-id).
- Optional defensive projection de-dup in `journal->provider-messages` /
  conversation rebuild is consistent with "projection derived purely from
  canonical state" and `robust(code)`; architecturally fine, not a misfit.

Actionable architectural misfits (see design-steps.md):
1. Recommended Option (B) anchors the guard to `:pending-tool-calls` — an
   agent-core runtime-handle data atom, explicitly *not* canonical `:state*`
   (doc/architecture.md "State boundary"). The architecture's stated direction
   is to project observable status worth querying into canonical `:state*`
   through dispatch and keep handles external. Leaning (B) "for minimal
   mechanism" under-weights that direction; the architectural call (B vs C)
   must be made explicitly and, if (B), documented as a deliberate deviation
   per the shims/adapters guidance (deviation requires documented design
   decision).
2. Option (B)'s "agent-core atomically decides applied?; journal append happens
   only when applied" fights the Dispatch sequencing contract
   (handler computes pure result → apply writes state → effects execute last).
   A stateful test-and-set against `:pending-tool-calls` at effect-decision time
   is a state mutation that gates effect emission, i.e. not a pure-result then
   effects-as-data shape. Prefer a pure guard in the dispatch handler reading a
   canonical predicate (recorded-result ids / pending set in `:state*`), emitting
   both effects or neither.
3. Cross-component layering: Option (B) co-locates the decision in agent-core
   (lower component) while the journal append is an agent-session (higher
   component) effect. Making a higher-layer effect conditional on a lower-layer
   atomic decision couples the layers. The agent-session pure handler should own
   the applied?/effects decision from canonical state; agent-core stays the data
   the handler reads.
