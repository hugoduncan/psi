# Implementation notes — 224

## Architecture-fit review (design.md)

Reviewed design.md for architectural fit (not ambiguity/correctness). Grounded
against AGENTS.md (S1–S3 VSM, dispatch-owns-writes, effects-as-data), META.md,
and doc/architecture.md (State boundary: canonical root vs runtime handles;
Dispatch sequencing contract; tool-execution dispatch ownership).

Fit confirmed (not misfits):
- Single-chokepoint enforcement is sound: both producers (interrupt path
  `turn.clj:223`, real-result path `tool_runtime_adapter.clj:114`) converge on
  the one pure handler `:session/tool-agent-record-result`
  (`session_mutations.clj:529`). Guarding there matches the `one_way` /
  single-source principle.
- First-writer-wins + suppression aligns with the impossible-invalid-states
  ethos (at-most-once invariant on tool-call-id).
- Optional defensive projection de-dup in `journal->provider-messages` /
  conversation rebuild is consistent with "projection derived purely from
  canonical state" and `robust(code)`; architecturally fine, not a misfit.

Actionable architectural misfits (see design-steps.md):
1. Recommended Option (B) anchors the guard to `:pending-tool-calls` — an
   agent-core runtime-handle data atom, explicitly *not* canonical `:state*`
   (doc/architecture.md "State boundary"). The architecture's stated direction
   is to project observable status worth querying into canonical `:state*`
   through dispatch and keep handles external. Leaning (B) "for minimal
   mechanism" under-weights that direction; the architectural call (B vs C)
   must be made explicitly and, if (B), documented as a deliberate deviation
   per the shims/adapters guidance (deviation requires documented design
   decision).
2. Option (B)'s "agent-core atomically decides applied?; journal append happens
   only when applied" fights the Dispatch sequencing contract
   (handler computes pure result → apply writes state → effects execute last).
   A stateful test-and-set against `:pending-tool-calls` at effect-decision time
   is a state mutation that gates effect emission, i.e. not a pure-result then
   effects-as-data shape. Prefer a pure guard in the dispatch handler reading a
   canonical predicate (recorded-result ids / pending set in `:state*`), emitting
   both effects or neither.
3. Cross-component layering: Option (B) co-locates the decision in agent-core
   (lower component) while the journal append is an agent-session (higher
   component) effect. Making a higher-layer effect conditional on a lower-layer
   atomic decision couples the layers. The agent-session pure handler should own
   the applied?/effects decision from canonical state; agent-core stays the data
   the handler reads.

## Architecture-fit follow-up resolution (design-steps)

Executed the three architecture-fit follow-up items. All three converge on one
decision; resolved together in design.md ("Design Decisions → D1").

- **Decision: Option (C), Option (B) rejected.** Guard via a canonical
  recorded-tool-result-ids predicate projected into `:state*` through dispatch,
  read purely by `:session/tool-agent-record-result`. Grounded in
  doc/architecture.md: State boundary (project queryable status into `:state*`;
  handles stay external), Dispatch sequencing contract (pure result → apply →
  effects last), and cross-component layering.
- **Code grounding confirmed:** `:pending-tool-calls` is an agent-core data atom
  mutated via `swap-data!` (`agent_core/core.clj:424`), i.e. a runtime handle —
  not canonical `:state*`. Producers: interrupt path `turn.clj:223`, real-result
  path `tool_runtime_adapter.clj:114`, both dispatching the same event into the
  unconditional handler `session_mutations.clj:529`.
- **Mechanism (pure both-or-neither):** handler reads canonical recorded-ids; if
  id present → no `:root-state-update`, emit neither effect; else →
  `:root-state-update` adds id, emit both effects. Atomicity from dispatch
  serialization (single writer to `:state*`), not a runtime test-and-set.
- `:pending-tool-calls` retained for interrupt enumeration only; no longer gates
  effects. Scope section in design.md updated to reference the canonical
  predicate instead of `:pending-tool-calls`.
- Plan-time detail flagged in D1: confirm the recorded-ids reset point (mirror
  `:pending-tool-calls` turn/session reset) so the set stays bounded.
- No blockers; all three items completed.
