# Implementation

## Design review — architectural fit (ψ)

Scope: design.md only; fit vs AGENTS.md / META.md / doc/architecture.md +
doc/project-nrepl.md. Not ambiguity/clarity/correctness.

Good fit:
- Q1 config key under `[:agent-session :project-nrepl]` with system<user<project
  precedence matches doc/project-nrepl.md precedence and existing
  `resolved-attach-endpoint` range-validation idiom.
- Subprocess launch + `.nrepl-port` polling correctly stay in the runtime handle
  (project nREPL registry) per the `:state*` boundary: runtime handles own
  side-effecting I/O; runtime-owned subprocess execution is the documented
  current state (Layer Map / Frontier), so staying outside dispatch effects is
  consistent — no misfit there.
- Uses existing `process-launcher` / `nrepl-connector` seams, no `with-redefs`.

Actionable architectural-fit gaps:
1. Stale-port guard placement. Design lets the guard touch the *shared*
   discovery helper while "not changing attach semantics". Started-mode
   acquisition policy (launch-time/mtime gate) should live in the started-mode
   layer, keeping the shared discovery primitive orthogonal (single
   responsibility) and attach-mode's documented `.nrepl-port` fallback intact.
2. Observable status projection. New observable outcomes (stale-port rejection
   diagnostics; effective configured timeout) are status; META principle =
   project observable status into `:state*` via dispatch as canonical data
   rather than surfacing only as ad-hoc op-return payload. Design should state
   whether/how the stale-port-rejection outcome is projected (the registry
   already projects `readiness`/`:last-error`).

## Design-review follow-up execution (ψ)

Executed both architectural-fit design-steps; both resolved in design.md (no
blockers — design-only task, decisions only).

- A1 (guard placement): stale-port gate goes in `started.clj`
  (`wait-for-started-endpoint!` / `start-instance-in!`), which already owns the
  started-process lifecycle and the launch instant. Shared
  `config/read-dot-nrepl-port` stays a mode-agnostic read+validate primitive;
  `attach/resolve-attach-endpoint` fallback unchanged. Verified by reading:
  `read-dot-nrepl-port` is called by both `wait-for-started-endpoint!` (via
  `read-dot-nrepl-port-safe`) and attach `resolve-attach-endpoint` → the gate
  must not live there.
- A2 (status projection): clarified the review's "`:state*` via dispatch"
  framing against the documented reality — the project-nrepl registry is a
  runtime handle, not dispatch state; subprocess + `.nrepl-port` I/O is
  documented runtime-owned (Layer Map / Frontier) and does not move under
  dispatch effects (consistent with the earlier design-review note in this file).
  Canonical status surface = the registry instance map (`runtime.clj`), read via
  `ops/instance-payload`. Decision: stale-port rejection → existing `:last-error`
  failure-path projection with distinct `:phase :started-stale-port`; effective
  timeout → new instance `:readiness-timeout-ms` status field surfaced through
  `instance-payload`; `ops/start` keeps projecting from `instance-payload` (no
  op-only status channel). Acceptance criteria updated to match.
